            <h2>About Me</h2> 
            <p>Hi y’all! My name is Rob Chant and I am a student in my first
             year of Algonquin College’s Interactive Media Design program. 
             I’ve studied at the College before as well – in 2012 I received 
             a certificate for completing the General Arts and Science – 
             Introduction to Fine Arts program. From there, I went on to the 
             University of Ottawa, where I received a Bachelor of Fine Arts 
             specializing in painting and drawing. I <em>definitely</em> like to get 
             creative!
            </p>

            <p>Outside of school I have worked in retail management for 
            most of my adult life. I’m currently a Floor Leader for Lush 
            Cosmetics, and love working for the brand. I live with my partner 
            and dog in Vanier, and in my spare time I love to practice yoga. 
            I’m also super into astrology: I'm a Leo sun, Virgo moon and 
            Capricorn rising. Otherwise, I enjoy tarot reading, and have 
            spent a lot of time carving my own linocut prints lately.
